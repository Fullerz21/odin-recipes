# Odin Recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project, where we build a basic recipe collection website using HTML. The goal of this assignment is to practice structuring web pages with HTML, creating links between pages, and adding simple content like images, descriptions, ingredients, and steps.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:### Iteration 1: Initial Structure

- Created a basic HTML structure in `index.html`.
- Added a main heading `<h1>` with the text "Odin Recipes".

### Iteration 2: Recipe Page

- Created a new directory `recipes/` inside the main `odin-recipes/` directory.
- Created an HTML page (e.g., `lasagna.html`) inside the `recipes/` directory for each recipe.
- Each recipe page contains:
  - A main heading `<h1>` with the recipe's name.
  - A link back to the `index.html` page.
  - A link from the `index.html` page to the recipe page.

### Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content

Each recipe page contains:

- An image of the finished dish.
- A "Description" section explaining the recipe.
- An "Ingredients" section with an unordered list of ingredients.
- A "Steps" section with an ordered list of steps to make the dish.

### Iteration 4: Add More Recipes

- Added two more recipes following the same structure.
- Updated the `index.html` page to include links to the new recipe pages.
- Organized the recipe links into an unordered list to keep the page neat.
